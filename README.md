# Adhesive-old-Bypass
adhesive old bypass

Hey , today im releasing a fivem stuff that was made from xo1337( so all credits go to him ) because some skids want to sell it and i don't really need it , i don't know if it still work fine but it might help some people before it get patched

so basically it's just a stuff that replace exception handler in ntdll , so you can patch some bytes how you want and replace with original bytes ( without adhesive ) , a old bad version of this one was leaked by xo1337 also but i think this one is better

if you sell this just fuck yourself
